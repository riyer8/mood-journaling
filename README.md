# Mood Journaling

Just a small hack to interactively type in a chatbox about your day and get emotions based off of your entry.

In order to run it, type this into the directory:

```bash
npm run start:all
```

Running into some errors with maximum photo storage upload.

next things to do:

- delete entries from journal
- in search, see if you can filter by emotion detection
- for the settings, see if you can add spacing in the theme
- the setting theme doesn't work right now.
- in the search feature, if you click on an entry, add a pop-up of the entry with a x sign in the corner that shows the journal entry
