# Mood Journaling

Just a small hack to interactively type in a chatbox about your day and get emotions based off of your entry.

In order to run it, type this into the directory:

```bash
npm run start:all
```

Running into some errors with maximum photo storage upload.

currently issues with sidebar not allowing to click on past entries to edit them. only allowed to click new entry on sidebar when on the journal page, and none of the other pages.
